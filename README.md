## Stellar Classification Dataset (SDSS17)
    This repository contains a stellar classification dataset (SDSS17) collected by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). 
    The dataset consists of 100,000 space observations, each described by 17 feature columns and 1 class column that 
    identifies whether it is a star, galaxy, or quasar.

## Data Source
    The data was obtained from Kaggle and can be found at the following link: Stellar Classification Dataset (SDSS17)

## Objective
    The objective of this project is to develop machine learning models to predict the class of celestial objects 
    (stars, galaxies, or quasars) based on their spectral characteristics, as well as to predict the redshift of 
    the data.

## Methodology
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploratory analysis of the data will be performed to understand the distribution 
    of features and explore possible relationships between variables.
    Data Preparation: The data will be preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and encoding of categorical 
    variables, if necessary.
    Modeling: Machine learning models will be trained, including classifiers to predict the class of celestial objects 
    and regression models to predict redshift.
    Model Evaluation: The models will be evaluated using appropriate metrics for each type of problem 
    (classification and regression).
    Interpretation of Results: The results will be interpreted to understand the importance of features, the predictive 
    capability of the models, and possible astronomical insights gained.
